# Selecting sensors for a stress detection wearable device

_Version 1.0_  
_Author(s): Jon Reifschneider, Duke University Pratt School of Engineering_

# Case Scenario
Long-term stress has been proven to have harmful health effects, ranging from headaches, sleeping difficulties, and even increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. The ability for individuals to automatically detect signs of ongoing stress can help them to seek intervention to reduce stress levels, resulting in a reduction in harmful side-effects.

You are an engineer working for a company developing a wearable chest-strap stress detection device which uses sensors to detect physiological signs of stress and then alerts the user so they can take proactive action to reduce stress, in order to mitigate potential long-term health effects. You have been asked to lead a project to determine which sensors need to be included on the new wearable device in order to accurately detect stress.
